# Customer Segmentation Analysis

This project demonstrates customer segmentation using K-Means and DBSCAN clustering techniques to identify distinct customer groups for targeted marketing strategies.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains customer transaction data, which includes key information used for clustering.

## Clustering Algorithms
- **K-Means**: Used to create 5 clusters based on customer behavior.
- **DBSCAN**: A density-based clustering algorithm, though it did not form meaningful clusters for this dataset.

## Requirements
You need to install the required dependencies. Instructions for different systems are provided below.

### For Windows
1. Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**.
2. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```cmd
   pip install -r requirements.txt
